hello, i am a new learner. Leaning git to be a better developer.
a rough repository just for learning purpose.
i just forget to tell you about learning signing into a new github account.
learning about crreating a new repository.

now i am on second step in this git learning process.


Still learning. Never stop learning.

you can't achieve success without trying..keep going until success touch your feet.

At last i finally completed my github tutorial.I enjoyed learning git finding it the best software for making projects in a team. 
But still i am not confident about my skills. I really need hardwork. I need a lot of practice. I need to revise it again and again
and need to create a second I'd so that i can learn making push and pull requests. but i need a repsitory too and need to create a 
file so that i can merge that file into my repository and in my oroginal repsoitory i need to accept pull request.
